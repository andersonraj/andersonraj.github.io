                    Black-ish’s Marcus Scribner has been a star on the Emmy-winning series since he was 13. Eight seasons later, 
                    and with the series finale on the horizon, we caught up with the actor to nerd-out on one of his favorite off-screen passions: 
                    Japanese Domestic Motors, otherwise known as JDM car culture.<br><br>

                    The JDM car scene first took hold in Japan—specifically Osaka. In the late ’80s, car enthusiasts started to take notice and
                    fall hard for Japan’s sports cars, giving birth to JDM car culture. The Fast and Furious movies only helped further the movement
                    into the spotlight, raising it to fever pitch levels. Suddenly car lovers were scouring the pages of auto trades buying up Honda
                    Civics to modify.<br><br>
                    
                    Not all Japanese cars can be categorized as JDM–only those made by Japanese automakers specifically to be sold in Japan could 
                    be considered so. Cars like the Nissan GT-R, Mark IV Toyota Supra, Mazda RX-7 FD3S, and Honda NSX soon became the holy grail. 
                    To this day, the mid-to-late ’90s cars remain the most covetable, gaining legendary status even amongst the uninitiated.<br><br>

                    But contrary to popular perception, JDM is not all chrome-plated rims, spinning, and flashy body kits. It’s about bringing out 
                    the beauty in the beast and its maximum performance through modifications that don’t compromise the original physical design of the vehicle. 
                    It’s about taking something mass-produced and turning it into a one-off, poured over with time, sweat, attention to detail, 
                    and a lot of love to create something unique.

                        There is a 25-year waiting period to import JDM cars. You can import a JDM car in the US only 25 years after it was released 
                        in the Japanese Domestic Market. So until very recently, even the Skyline GT-R was illegal in America..
